# waterfilling demo
This is an interactive demo to tinker with the waterfilling solution to total power constrained power allocation across parallel channels for sum-rate maximization.

It lets you specify the ni/gi ratios for 4 channels (pick any number from 0.01 to 10) and vary the total power (using a slider), and shows the corresponding "water-level" parameter and the power allocated to each channel both pictorially and as numbers.
